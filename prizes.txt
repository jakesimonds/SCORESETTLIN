About
LayerZero is a messaging protocol that connects 150+ blockchains, enabling seamless communication and value transfer between them. With Omnichain Fungible Tokens (OFTs), developers can make any token move natively across multiple chains without wrapped assets or fragmented liquidity. Using LayerZero’s SDKs and smart contract templates, hackers can build omnichain DeFi protocols, cross-chain services, and interoperable applications.
Prizes

Best Developer Feedback
$750
Build the best omnichain application using LayerZero’s cross-chain messaging protocol and Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard. Projects should demonstrate seamless token or data movement across multiple blockchains. Whether it’s a DeFi protocol, game, NFT marketplace, or novel cross-chain tool, the most innovative and technically sound implementations of LayerZero’s architecture will win. Judges will evaluate creativity, functionality, and how effectively the project leverages omnichain interoperability.
Qualification Requirements
To qualify for the Best Omnichain Implementation track, participants must adhere to the following criteria:
1. Interact with the LayerZero Endpoint contract using either the LayerZero Contracts Library or your own custom integration to send / receive a cross-chain message.
2. Extend the Base Contract Logic: It's not sufficient to simply inherit the OApp / OFT / Endpoint interface contracts; the developer must also extend it. This means adding new functionalities, features, or optimizations that create new cross-chain use cases. The extension should demonstrate innovation and an advanced understanding of the LayerZero tech-stack.
3. Working Demo: Hackathons have a tough time crunch, and we respect you all for learning to work with our tools so fast! Please focus on having the core contract working, and clean the rest up after.
4. Feedback Form:When hacking, hard to use, buggy, or confusing documentation and tooling can ruin your experience! Please take the time to submit any feedback that you think might be useful for how we can improve your lives when building on LayerZero! The best feedback submission will win $750! Please submit using the form linked under "Resources".

About
EVVM let's anyone create Virtual Blockchains on top of any chain just deploying smart contracts. Basically it's an infra-less abstract blockchain inside any blockchain!

You can use any existing network like Ethereum, Polygon, CELO, Hedera and others.

Just use the MATE Metaprotocol (our EVVM testnet) or spin up your own virtual blockchain environment by simply deploying our smart contracts, instead of running a whole new network (infra, consensus, distribution, etc). We offer one-command deployment tools, npm packages, a fully Scaffold-EVVM and more tooling ready to use!

Using the EVVM you have the benefits of a custom blockchain, easy to modify and without managing physical infrastructure: no validators or dedicated nodes!.

When an EVVM instance runs on any chain (as set of Solidity contracts) it abstracts the core components of a blockchain, inheriting the security of the underlying chain. A "blockchain within a blockchain", similar to a virtual machine in computing, like VMWare and VirtualBox.

We are looking for any novel use cases, including: Gasless Payments, Custom Native Tokens, Improve x402 & ERC-8004 capabilities and more.

Developers can also use EVVM as a sandbox to experiment with new features or Ethereum improvements (like testing new opcodes or economic models) in an controled environment, without affecting the main chain.

Are you ready to be part of the future of Ethreum?

Build using Chainlink during ETHGlobal Buenos Aires!
Total Prizes:
- Connect the World with Chainlink: Total 3 teams
- Best workflow with Chainlink CRE: Total 3 teams
Prizes
🌎 Connect the World with Chainlink ⸺ $6,000
Up to 3 teams will receive $2,000
Build something awesome using Chainlink! Anything that came from the Chainlink Documentation counts - using CCIP, Price Feeds, Data Streams, PoR or VRF.
Note: Please use CRE instead of using Chainlink Functions or Automation. These products will be deprecated, and any project that needs this type of functionality should use CRE instead.
Qualification Requirements
Requirements:
- Each project must use a Chainlink service in some form to make a state change on a blockchain, otherwise it will not be eligible for the Chainlink core prizes. This means that a front end simply reading from Chainlink Data Feeds doesn't count. Using Chainlink inside your smart contracts is required.
- While all project submissions are evaluated holistically, there will be bonus points given to projects that use multiple Chainlink services in a meaningful way.
- Please let us know how you use Chainlink in the project description.

🔗 Best workflow with Chainlink CRE ⸺ $9,000
Up to 3 teams will receive $3,000
Build your first workflow with CRE! Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) is an all-in-one orchestration layer that enables developers to build institutional-grade smart contracts — data-connected, compliance-ready, privacy-preserving, and interoperable across blockchains and traditional systems. With CRE, you can connect blockchains to external APIs, enterprise systems, data sources, LLMs, or AI agents.
Using the CRE SDK (available in Go and TypeScript), you’ll build Workflows — modular programs that orchestrate logic across on-chain and off-chain environments. With the CRE CLI, you can compile, simulate, and deploy these workflows to CRE, where they run on a Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) for fault-tolerant execution.
Qualification Requirements
Requirements:
✅ Goal:
Build, simulate, or deploy a CRE Workflow that’s used as an orchestration layer within your project.
✅ Your workflow should:
- Integrate at least one blockchain with an external API, system, data source, LLM, or AI agent.
- Demonstrate a successful simulation (via the CRE CLI) or a live deployment on the CRE network.
- Be meaningfully used in your project
💡 If you show us a successfully simulated workflow execution, our team will deploy it to the live CRE network for you during the hackathon!

What to build:
ROFL (Runtime Off-chain Logic) apps run inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). They rely on Sapphire for registration, billing, virtual machine management, and secure storage of secrets and configuration. Execution with ROFL takes place entirely off-chain, making it ideal for compute-intensive or always-on services such as secure decentralized oracles, bridges, AI agents, LLM chatbots, and more. Redundancy is possible with native support for replicas. Apps running with ROFL can also access its integrated key management service, allowing Sapphire smart contracts to verify that a transaction was genuinely signed from within the TEE. Additionally you can add multisig admin control over your apps deployed with ROFL for higher integrity.
Please note: The Oasis Foundation reserves the right to adjust the reward structure based on the quality and relevance of the submissions received.
Qualification Requirements

Zircuit is a ZK rollup with AI-enabled security at the sequencer level.​ Built by a team of web3 security veterans and PhDs in computer science, algorithms, and cryptography, Zircuit is backed by Pantera Capital, Dragonfly Capital, and Maelstrom.
Prizes
🏆 Best DeFi Project on Zircuit ⸺ $6,000
🥇
1st place
$3,750
🥈
2nd place
$2,250
Apply your hacking skills to generate the best APY or improve the user experience of DeFi for the masses on Zircuit. This prize will be split among the best DeFi protocols that deploy on Zircuit, with quality, security, and novelty being the deciding factors. Remember: deploying on Zircuit is as easy as changing your endpoint in your favorite development framework and a project is eligible as long as the contracts are deployed on Zircuit and verified.
These DeFi protocols are the ones that will launch a new DeFi summer. Your project should be clearly identifiable as a DeFi protocol. Quality, completeness, and security are paramount. A protocol that lets you (or others!) steal from your users is not a winning submission. Use cases should be well thought out and documented. Through superior UI/UX or novel use cases for staking, your project should aim to give well established DeFi juggernauts cause for concern.
This bounty will be judged based on completeness, execution, and creativity.
Qualification Requirements
1) Project contracts must be deployed on the Zircuit Testnet and verified via the Zircuit Explorer.
2) A GitHub repository containing the project artifacts (contracts, tests, documentation) and a solid README or short video demo of the project. The README should include:
- a clear short one-sentence description of your submission
- a short description of what you integrated Zircuit with and how
- short description of the team and their backgrounds
- clear instructions for testing the integration
- feedback describing your experience with building on Zircuit
optionally, a short video demo or slide deck.

🧩 Best use of Account Abstraction ⸺ $3,500
🥇
1st place
$2,250
🥈
2nd place
$1,250
Zircuit supports EIP-7702 which brings some account abstraction on-chain. This bounty is to use this functionality in a new and complete way on-chain. This can include deploying contracts to delegate to, interfaces to use the new transaction types, and more. Remember: deploying on Zircuit is as easy as changing your endpoint in your favorite development framework. You may need to use command line tools to use 7702 functionality (see the links!).
A successful submission will include a functional prototype that solves the problem it’s intended to address. It will showcase some innovation/creativity, either through technological or UI improvements. It may be complete and solve a long-standing open problem or introduce something with a lot of potential for future development. Either way, it has an impact on the Zircuit ecosystem.
Winning projects should have a user-centered design that makes it easy for the target audience. This can be end users or developers integrating the project into their own codebase. The best may also include clean and consistent visual designs.
Any interesting blockchain applications are welcome. Novel ideas are more impressive than clones of existing projects, though there are certainly times where clones include significant improvements. Those that are very technical may impress the judges if done correctly but simpler ideas may be easier to do well. This bounty will be judged based on completeness, execution, and creativity.
Qualification Requirements
1) Project contracts must be deployed on the Zircuit Mainnet or Garfield Testnet and verified via the Zircuit Explorer.
2) A GitHub repository containing the project artifacts (contracts, tests, documentation) and a solid README or short video demo of the project. The README should include:

🌟 Best Zircuit Integration ⸺ $500
Integrate Zircuit into your favorite web3 project. Bring Zircuit to wallets, dev tools, bridges, or any other dApp. Grow the Zircuit Ecosystem by connecting Zircuit to the best that web3 has to offer.
Success looks like Zircuit running with an on- or off-chain app or tool that didn’t support it before. The integration should be correct and functional, but does not need to be complicated. Some integrations can be as simple as adding a chain ID or a node URL to a file. The project should have an impact on the Zircuit ecosystem by expanding its reach.
This bounty will be judged based on completeness, usefulness, execution, and creativity.

Prizes
🏆 AuditAgent: Find, Fix, and Fortify ⸺ $500
Smart contract security remains one of the toughest challenges in Web3 — and the gap is widening. As AI accelerates code generation and vibe coding pushes unaudited contracts to the Ethereum mainnet, vulnerabilities are slipping through faster than review processes or traditional audits can catch them.
AuditAgent fights fire with fire. It’s an AI-powered pre-auditing solution that uses large language models to analyze smart contract source code, documentation, and specifications — detecting vulnerabilities, inconsistencies, and logic flaws before deployment.
In this challenge, you’ll put AuditAgent to the test:
Run it on your own smart contracts, identify a major vulnerability, and fix it.
Your mission: demonstrate how AI-driven auditing can make your contracts safer and your development process more secure.
Your Challenge:
1. Run AuditAgent on one or more of your smart contracts.
2. Use its analysis to identify a genuine vulnerability or logical issue.
3. Fix the issue and submit your before/after code along with a brief summary of what you found.
The goal is to showcase real impact — using AI to strengthen your code.
Qualification Requirements
Prize of $500 — awarded to the best submission demonstrating:
- A real, meaningful vulnerability identified and resolved using AuditAgent.
- A high-quality fix that effectively addresses the issue.
Judging Criteria:
1. Impact of the Discovery
- Significance and severity of the vulnerability found.
2. Use of AuditAgent
- How effectively the tool was leveraged to identify and address the issue.
3. Quality of the Fix
- How well the patch resolves the problem and improves contract safety.

🏆 The Agentic Frontier: Coordination Without Permission ⸺ $2,500
Ethereum is not just a blockchain; it is the most open coordination protocol ever built. It enables anyone, whether human or machine, to participate in shared rules, value exchange, and governance without requiring permission.
Your challenge is to build the missing infrastructure, tools, or mechanisms that make Ethereum a natural environment for agents. Not just agents using Ethereum, but agents that belong on Ethereum—able to transact, reason, coordinate, and collaborate.
Ask yourself:
- What would make an autonomous agent choose Ethereum as its operating ground?
- How can Ethereum’s openness, composability, and credible neutrality become useful primitives for agentic systems?
- And, inversely, where can AI be genuinely useful to the human Ethereum community? How might agents augment governance, collective research, public goods, or community coordination?
We’re interested in the connective tissue: the foundations that allow agents and humans to coordinate effectively, transparently, and trustlessly.
Possible Directions:
- Agent Coordination Primitives
- Economic Infrastructure for Agents
- Governance Augmentation
- Bridging Cognition and Consensus
- Collective Missions
Qualification Requirements
Requirements:
- Your project must explore autonomous or semi-autonomous coordination via Ethereum, not just basic contract calls.
- Include at least one component demonstrating agentic reasoning, decision-making, or cooperation.
- Provide a short write-up or demo video explaining both why Ethereum matters and how the agentic aspect functions.
- Strong entries will demonstrate an understanding of how to attract agents, including what problem they’d solve, what value they’d gain, and why Ethereum is the right foundation.
Judging Criteria:
- Visionary Potential
- Originality
- Coherence
- Execution
- Go-to-Market for Agents
- Composability

🏆 AgentArena: Build the Next Generation of Security Agents ⸺ $3,000
AI is transforming the battlefield of smart contract security. As vibe coding accelerates and more unaudited protocols rush to deployment, vulnerabilities are slipping through human review processes. At the same time, AI-driven attackers are getting faster, smarter, and more adaptive; therefore, the defenders must evolve too.
AgentArena is where that evolution takes place — a competitive platform where AI security agents battle-test smart contracts to uncover vulnerabilities before they fall prey to hackers. Each agent acts independently, scanning, reasoning, and reporting vulnerabilities for bounties.
This hackathon invites agent builders, AI researchers, and security engineers to build new agents that will join the swarm competing in AgentArena.
Your mission: create the most capable, creative, and effective autonomous agent for vulnerability discovery.
Your Challenge:
- Build a new security agent using our Agent Template
- Design your own strategy — whether it’s reasoning-driven, model-assisted, heuristic-based, or something entirely new.
- Optimize for insight, depth, and originality in how your agent identifies vulnerabilities.
- Compete for a $3,000 grand prize and a place in the next generation of autonomous code security.
Even if you don’t win the prize, all submitted agents can continue to evolve and participate in future AgentArena competitions, earning bounties for every valid exploit they uncover.
Qualification Requirements
Your agent will be evaluated on:
1. Strategy & Creativity
- How original and effective is your approach to vulnerability detection?
- Does your agent demonstrate a clear reasoning process or novel search strategy?
2. Performance in Test Runs
- Quality and relevance of the vulnerabilities identified in our test repositories.
- Depth of analysis and ability to surface meaningful security insights.
3. Code Quality
- Clean structure, clarity, and readability of your implementation.

🏆 Building Verifiable Agents with the Triple-Verified Stack ⸺ $4,000
🥇
1st place
$2,500
🥈
2nd place
$1,500
The age of autonomous agents is here, but it runs on a massive trust deficit. How do you prove an AI agent did what it was supposed to do, and nothing more?
ChaosChain is the accountability protocol for the agentic economy.
We're building the open-source infrastructure to make AI agents trustworthy by design. We invite you to build on our Triple-Verified Stack, a framework for end-to-end verifiable agent workflows:
1. Intent Verification: Proof that a human authorized an action.
2. Process Integrity: Proof that the correct code was executed (leveraging TEEs like EigenCompute or just a hash of the code).
3. Outcome Adjudication/Accountability: On-chain consensus that the result was valuable and correct.
Built on open standards like AP2, x402 and ERC-8004, ChaosChain turns trust into a programmable primitive. Your challenge is to utilize our SDKs to develop an application or service that leverages one or more verifiable AI agents. Show us what's possible when you can cryptographically prove an agent's identity, actions, and results.
What can you build with this?
- Verifiable Risk Oracles for DeFi
- Autonomous E-commerce Agents that handle payments
- Decentralized service marketplaces
- Auditable scientific research agents
- Autonomous DAO Manager
- Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) Agen
The possibilities are endless when trust is a primitive.
Qualification Requirements
Qualifications:
1. Use the ChaosChain SDK (Python or TypeScript) as a core component of your stack.
2. Implement x402 payment flow (verify + settle), via our hosted facilitator (embedded in our sdk).
3. Show at least one verifiability link in the chain (preferably more):
- AP2-signed intent, and/or
- Process integrity artifact (hash/attestation/log), and
- Outcome anchoring with ERC-8004 (proof/claim/registry write or mock if testnet).
4. Submit a 2–3 min demo video + public GitHub with setup instructions.
Judging Criteria:
1. End-to-end verifiability: clear mapping of Intent (AP2) → Process integrity → Outcome adjudication (ERC-8004).
2. Correct x402 integration: proper 402 flow, verify/settle, real (or testnet) payments.
3. Utility & UX: solves a real agentic use case; smooth DX for other builders.
4. Technical depth: thoughtful architecture, clean code, receipts/links to proofs.
5. Presentation: concise video, readable README, reproducible demo.

About
Citrea is EVM compatible, the first ZK Rollup on Bitcoin, featuring a BitVM-based trust-minimized bridge called Clementine. Ensuring on-chain verifiability and data availability on Bitcoin, Citrea makes it possible to build everything as a Bitcoin Application - a ₿app.
Through its trust-minimized (1-of-N) Bitcoin bridge Clementine and fully EVM-compatible execution environment, Citrea unlocks the trillion-dollar asset base of Bitcoin to be utilized in DeFi and money markets, tapping a massive liquidity, without any change to Bitcoin’s consensus.
Prizes
🐸 Best Degen Bapps (Bitcoin Applications) ⸺ $6,000
🥇
1st place
$4,000
🥈
2nd place
$2,000
Citrea opens the door to an entirely new class of Bitcoin powered experiments. Some brilliant, some chaotic, some beautifully unhinged. The Best Degen Bapp track is for the builders who think outside the box, break assumptions, push boundaries, and ship the kind of ideas that make people say:
“Wait… you built what on Bitcoin?”
This track looks for creativity in its rawest form, whether your project looks impractical, shockingly clever, or something so new that it breaks normal categories. If it makes us laugh, mock, or rethink what Bitcoin applications can be, you're in the right place.
We can't actually give examples for this category but here are few we could think of:
Bitcoin native social experiments: Chaotic coordination games, on-chain memes with mechanics, self destroying apps for privacy (somehow).
Game-Fi but Bitcoinized: Mine to Mint apps, Burn to mint puzzles, proof of vibes systems, mining inspired game mechanics.
Useless but brilliant tools: Anything that feels like why we need crypto for this but is actually genius.
Weird primitives: Be creative. Look for mechanisms no one asked for but everyone suddenly needs.
“Why not?” apps: If it breaks regular models, that’s the energy we look for. Look for daily apps and how to enable them Bapps.
If your project fits nowhere else, it probably belongs here.
Building for this track does not prevent you from also applying to the Innovation track. Let chaos inspire you.
Qualification Requirements
- Integrate Citrea (contracts deployed to Citrea testnet and/or frontend using Citrea RPC)
- Explain how you’re using Citrea in the description
- Be open source (public GitHub during judging)
- Show a working demo (ideally a deployed live link, or video + alternatively provide instructions to build & run on a local environment or showcase to the Jury at booth)
- Include any necessary links, deployed addresses/tx hashes, and etc.

About
Designed for builders, VisualSign makes it simple to render trustworthy signing flows, reduce cross-chain complexity, and ship safer UX—fast. Wallet and dapp teams can give users transparent approvals; protocol developers can define how complex transactions should appear across any VisualSign-aware wallet.
Prizes
📈 Most Strategically Valuable Integration ⸺ $5,000
Using VisualSign the project must integrate with one of the "Top-Tier" protocols (example provided below). The prize will go to the top three teams with the best and most strategic use of VisualSign. This prize is not for the "coolest" or "most creative" hack, but is a targeted bounty to manufacture a high-quality, high-prestige case study.
Please read the qualification requirements carefully.
Qualification Requirements
This $5,000 prize effectively commissions the creation of a "killer feature" demo. The winning project will be the tangible proof-of-concept shown to other wallets and dApps, demonstrating that VisualSign can successfully render complex, high-value transactions on a real-world target.
Evaluation will be based on the complexity of the transactions parsed. A parser for a simple swap is far less valuable than one that clearly renders complex, multi-step interactions such as stake, borrow, delegate, or create_pool.
Top tier protocols to integrate with: Aave, Curve Finance, EigenLayer, Ethena, Ether.Fi, Lido, SparkLend, Uniswap. If there is a specific project that you work with and can see VisualSign integrated with in a strategically valuable way please use that!

🤝 Utilize VisualSign for dapps ⸺ $5,000
Up to 4 teams will receive $1,250
Use VisualSign across any dapp of your choice. The goal is to see all that VisualSign can interact with! We’re calling on builders to create with VisualSign across dapps, and to reimagine secure signing.
Qualification Requirements
This PR must contain a working VisualSign-parser chain module for ethereum for at least one function on a unique Ethereum dApp.

About
vlayer is a cryptographic protocol that connects the offchain web with onchain trust. It transforms private data from web, email, and on-chain sources into verifiable proofs using Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC). Developers can securely verify and integrate data into Ethereum smart contracts without exposing sensitive information, powering applications in identity, reputation, finance, and data verification.
vouch, built on vlayer, uses Web Proofs (zkTLS) to verify user-owned data directly from trusted online platforms without ever accessing or storing sensitive information. Users generate cryptographic attestations locally on their devices through the vouch Chrome extension or mobile app (iOS and Android), ensuring every verification is private, tamper-proof, and transparent.
Build with vlayer to create applications that bring real-world data on-chain - privately, securely, and verifiably.
Prizes
🧠 Best ZK Proving dApp ⸺ $4,000
Build the next generation of privacy-preserving applications using vlayer’s ZK Prover Server - a REST API that compresses Web Proofs into zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). Prove the validity of real-world web data without revealing its contents. Think: privacy-preserving verification for the internet 🌍
💡 Example Use Cases:
- Real-World Data Feeds: Feed verified web data (e.g., commodity prices, weather APIs) into smart contracts.
- Proof of Engagement: Prove you posted, commented, or followed someone on social media - and verify it on-chain.
- Reputation Scoring: Aggregate verified actions across platforms into a unified, on-chain reputation score.
- Trustless Oracles: Combine vlayer proofs with existing oracles (like Chainlink or Redstone) for hybrid verification.
Qualification Requirements
This application has it all - a great idea and a best-in-class implementation. To qualify, the project must use vlayer’s Web Prover Server (POST /compress-web-proof and POST /verify-zk-proof), and incorporate both Prover and Verifier smart contracts. Developers must also provide proof of RISC Zero contract deployment.

⚙️ Best Server-Side Proving dApp ⸺ $3,000
🥇
1st place
$2,000
🥈
2nd place
$1,000
Build something awesome using vlayer’s Web Prover Server - a REST API for generating and verifying cryptographic web proofs with the TLSNotary (TLSN) protocol. With just a few lines of code, you can prove that data came from any public endpoint or OAuth call (like Reddit, GitHub, Twitter, or an exchange API) - without exposing your private information. Turn any HTTPS response into a trustless proof verifiable by anyone 🤯
💡 Example Use Cases:
- Reddit Identity Verifier: Prove your Reddit username by generating a TLS proof of your /api/v1/me profile.
- GitHub Contributor Badge: Verify open-source contributions directly from the GitHub API.
- Proof of Assets: Generate Web Proofs from exchange APIs (like Binance or Coinbase) to show account balances without revealing personal info.
Qualification Requirements
The application must generate Web Proofs using vlayer’s Web Prover Server for server-side proof generation and verification (POST /prove and POST /verify).

🪪 Best vouch Integration ⸺ $2,000
vouch enables applications to verify user-owned data from internet platforms without accessing or storing sensitive information. Using vouch’s existing data sources - or a new one you create - integrate vouch Web Proofs into your application to unlock privacy-preserving credentials and verification.
💡 Example Use Cases:
- Identity & Age Verification Credential: Verify age or residency without exposing personal details, and issue a vouch claim such as “User X is over 18” or “Resident in Jurisdiction J.”
- Social Media Engagement Credential: Verify a user’s follower count, posts, or community memberships (e.g., Reddit, Twitter), and issue a vouch attestation like “User X has >1,000 followers and posted in r/web3.”
Qualification Requirements
The application must use vlayer’s client-side proving service (vouch) to generate Web Proofs. Developers may use existing data sources or create new ones.

🔧 BONUS TRACK: Build a Custom vouch Data Source ⸺ $1,000
Push the boundaries of what vouch can do by creating a brand new data source for the vouch catalog.
This track rewards builders who go beyond integration - extending the protocol itself with new verified data types, APIs, or attestation logic that others can reuse across the ecosystem.
💡 Example Use Cases:
- YouTube Creator Credential: Add a data source that attests to a creator’s subscriber count, view count, or verified channel status.
- Financial Data Source: Build integrations for platforms like Robinhood, Revolut, or Kraken to verify balances, transactions, or activity metrics.
- Academic Credential Source: Integrate APIs from Coursera, edX, or university verification portals to attest to course completions or degrees.
Qualification Requirements
Must create a new vouch data source in the vouch catalog that demonstrates a new use case and/or improves the protocol.

Circles is building a social money, enabling people to create their personal self-owned currency, and build fair community currencies.
Prizes
💵 Build a P2P Loan Market based on Circles Network ⸺ $3,500
Build a peer-to-peer lending platform that uses Circles' trust graph as a credit scoring mechanism. Build systems where loan terms, interest rates, and collateral requirements are determined by trust relationships rather than traditional credit scores, enabling under-collateralized lending between trusted community members. Loans could be taken out in CRC or in other collateral, such as stables. Users’ personal CRC might (or might not) figure in the scheme as interest token, with the limited rate of personal CRC creation limiting the rate at which loans can be taken out.
Qualification Requirements
- Use of Relative Trust score api endpoint (optional)
- GUI for the loan experience (trust score page, borrowing, lending)

About
Aztec is the privacy-native Layer 2 on Ethereum. It empowers developers to build applications that protect user privacy while enabling compliance. Backed by a $100M Series B led by a16z, Aztec is led by a team of world-class researchers and cryptographers who invented trustless client-side proving—the innovation that makes privacy-preserving apps on mobile possible. Using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and the Noir open-source, Rust-like programming language, Aztec is building a secure and scalable privacy layer for the decentralized future.
Prizes
⛓️ Privacy Across Chains ⸺ $2,000
Privacy becomes more powerful across chains. Build applications that compose protocols across chains through Aztec's privacy layer to discover entirely new use cases that only work when privacy is composable across ecosystems. Leverage our bridge partners (Holonym, Substance Labs, Train, Wormhole and more) to create cross-chain experiences that weren't possible before.
Qualification Requirements
• Must use Aztec Devnet's latest version
• Must integrate with at least one of our bridge partners: Holonym, Substance Labs, Train or Wormhole
• Application must leverage the Aztec network to either relay messages or send funds across chains
• Must clearly demonstrate how Aztec's privacy layer enables the cross-chain interaction (not just use Aztec as an additional chain)

🫆 Identity Infrastructure ⸺ $2,000
Only with native privacy can identity infrastructure work on-chain, because sensitive information simply cannot be exposed. Build on Aztec to create identity systems where people host credentials, attestations, or identity data that they can leverage across applications, whether on Aztec itself or composed cross-chain. This could be credential systems, DID infrastructure, verification mechanisms, aggregated attestations from multiple sources (like combining OpenBanking.nr and ZKPassport), or novel ways to prove facts about yourself without exposing everything.
Qualification Requirements
• Must use Aztec Devnet's latest version
• Must either compose in novel ways with existing identity applications like ZKPassport or create new ways of proving facts about yourself (attesting)
• Must clearly demonstrate how Aztec's privacy layer becomes the identity infrastructure (not just use Aztec as an additional chain)
• Identity data and control must remain with the user, not dependent on a centralized authority
- Submission must include documentation or demo showing how end users would interact with and manage their identity

🤯 Rethinking What's Possible ⸺ $1,000
Privacy unlocks a design space we haven't fully explored yet. We know there are applications that become possible with native privacy that we haven't seen before. Build the thing that makes us say 'oh wow, that's why privacy matters.' This could be gaming mechanics, governance systems, DeFi patterns we haven't seen, confidential business logic, or something we haven't thought of. The constraint is: it should only be possible because Aztec has native privacy.
Qualification Requirements
• Must use Aztec Devnet's latest version
• Must clearly demonstrate how this application can only exist due to Aztec's privacy layer (not just use Aztec as an additional chain)
• Must include clear documentation explaining why this application requires native privacy and how Aztec's specific capabilities enable it
• Should demonstrate a testable implementation or working prototype (not just concept/wireframes)

About
Babylon Labs is building the Bitcoin Trustless Vault — a protocol that allows Bitcoin holders to participate in DeFi ecosystems without ever relinquishing custody of their BTC. This new primitive enables Bitcoin to become truly composable with other assets and ecosystems in a trust‑minimized way.
Your challenge: design or prototype integrations that showcase new DeFi use cases for the Bitcoin Trustless Vault on Ethereum.
Note that this product is still under active development and auditing and not yet open-source.
💡 Challenge Focus
We want builders to imagine what happens when BTC can seamlessly and securely back DeFi protocols. Think about how Vault‑secured BTC could power:
- Lending / Borrowing protocols (trustless BTC‑collateralized loans)
- Stablecoins (BTC‑backed or partially collateralized stable assets)
- Derivatives or Perpetual Futures (BTC‑based synthetic exposure)
- Insurance / Risk Products (slashing coverage, principal protection)
- Yield Aggregators / Restaking systems (BTC earning on‑chain yield)
Your proposal should explain both the financial mechanism (how the Vaulted BTC interacts with an Ethereum DeFi primitive) and the cryptoeconomic rationale (why it’s safe, decentralized, and novel).

About
Espresso is the base layer for rollups, delivering fast, secure finality and reliable data availability. Developers building on rollups integrated with Espresso can rely on Espresso’s consensus to achieve instant, trust-minimized finality and build applications that react safely and quickly across chains.
Espresso’s fast and secure finality unlocks a new era of cross-chain applications.
Imagine using a bridge between two rollups — Rollup A and Rollup B. When sending funds from A (the source) to B (the destination), those funds must first be locked on A before being released on B.
To ensure safety, you must be confident that the transaction on the source chain cannot be reverted. Traditionally, you’ve had three options:
- Wait for finality on the parent chain — secure but slow (can take hours).
- Skip waiting and assume the risk — fast but unsafe.
- Use Espresso confirmations — fast and secure, powered by the Espresso Network’s consensus.
Prizes

Best Cross-Chain Application deployed on ANY Espresso-integrated chain (Celo, ApeChain, Rari, Appchain, Molten, T3rn, NodeOps, Rufus, Huddle01, LogX).
Qualification Requirements
The application must:
- Have a cross-chain interaction (from a source chain to a destination chain). You can use message protocols like Hyperlane to perform the cross-chain interaction.
- The source chain must be an Espresso-integrated chain (ApeChain, Rari, Appchain, Molten, T3rn, NodeOps, Rufus, Huddle01, LogX, Celo).
The application must:
- The message protocol (for example, Hyperlane), must read from the Espresso's Caff Node RPC. This is just a normal RPC instrumented to read from the Espresso Network.

📲 Best Miniapp in a Group Chat ⸺ $2,500
build something your group of friends would actually use every day: to play, trade, vote, bet, share, or just have fun together.
Qualification Requirements
Although there’s no native chat integration for mini apps (like fetching current group members), teams can still deliver full group chat experiences by using a hybrid combination of agents to access context—for example, a chat‑resident agent paired with a backend coordinator—to infer group membership and state and orchestrate collaborative actions inside chat.
