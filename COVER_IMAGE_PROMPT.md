# Cover Image Generation Prompt

## Project: Score Settlin'

**Tagline:** "IRL bets, settled on-chain"

## Concept
A playful social betting game where you make bold claims about yourself, take a selfie as proof, and let the crowd decide if you're telling the truth.

## Visual Elements to Include

### Core Flow (left to right):
1. **Phone with NFC tap** - Someone tapping their phone
2. **Selfie/claim bubble** - Person making a bold claim with camera
3. **Bluesky logo** - Post goes to social media
4. **T / F voting** - People voting True or False
5. **Two outcomes:**
   - Tokens flowing to winner (TRUE)
   - Photo being posted/exposed (FALSE)

### Branding
- Fun, meme-y, slightly chaotic energy
- Colors: Bluesky blue + Celo yellow/green
- Style: Flat illustration or pixel art would work well

### Text on Image
- "Score Settlin'"
- "Make a claim. Take a selfie. Let the crowd decide."
- Optional: "TRUE = tokens | FALSE = exposed"

### Logos to Include
- Bluesky butterfly
- Celo
- ENS (optional)
- Ethereum (for ENS resolution)

## Mood/Vibe
- Hackathon energy
- Social + crypto mashup
- Playful accountability
- "Put your money where your mouth is" energy

## Dimensions
- Bluesky banner: 1500x500px recommended
- Profile pic: 400x400px (could be just the logo/icon)

## Example Scene
A person confidently claiming "I can do 20 pushups" with their selfie, surrounded by flying T and F votes, with tokens on one side and a "wall of shame" photo gallery on the other.
